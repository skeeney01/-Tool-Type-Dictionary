# README

This repository contains two dicitionaries to support the BCO Library. The 'toolsDictionary.json' file contains a list of key-value pairs, keys being the tool type and the values are the tools. The 'toolTypeDescription.json' file contains the same tool type keys with the values being short descriptions of the tool type. This file will aid in the classification of tools that are added to the tooltype dictionary.
